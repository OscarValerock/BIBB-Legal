## IV. Your Rights

Under applicable data‑protection laws, you have the following rights:

### 1. Right of Information

You may request confirmation of whether we process personal data concerning you. If so, you may obtain information about:

- The recipients or categories of recipients of the personal data
- The planned duration of storage or the criteria used to determine that duration
- The existence of rights to rectification, deletion, restriction of processing or objection
- The right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority

### 2. Right to Rectification

You have the right to have inaccurate personal data corrected and incomplete data completed **without delay**.

### 3. Right of Restriction

You may request restriction of processing if:

1. You contest the accuracy of the data (for a period enabling verification);
2. Processing is unlawful and you oppose deletion;
3. We no longer need the data for processing purposes, but you need it for legal claims; or
4. You objected under Art. 21 (1) GDPR and verification is pending.

### 4. Right to Deletion ("Right to be Forgotten")

#### a) Obligation to Delete

We must delete your personal data **without undue delay** if:

- It is no longer necessary for the purposes collected.
- You withdraw consent (Art. 6 (1) a or Art. 9 (2) a GDPR) and no other legal basis exists.
- You object under Art. 21 (1) GDPR and no overriding legitimate grounds exist, or you object under Art. 21 (2) GDPR.
- The data was processed unlawfully.
- Deletion is required by legal obligation.
- The data was collected in relation to information‑society services per Art. 8 (1) GDPR.

If we have made the data public, we will take reasonable steps (including technical measures) to inform other controllers processing the data that you requested deletion of links, copies or replications.

#### b) Exceptions

The right to deletion does **not** apply where processing is necessary:

- To exercise freedom of expression and information;
- To comply with a legal obligation or perform a task in the public interest/exercise of official authority;
- For public‑interest reasons in public health (Art. 9 (2) h, i and 9 (3) GDPR);
- For archiving in the public interest, scientific/historical research or statistical purposes (Art. 89 (1) GDPR) where deletion would seriously impair those objectives; or
- To assert, exercise or defend legal claims.

### 5. Right to Notification

If you exercise rights to rectification, deletion or restriction, we will notify each recipient of your personal data unless impossible or involving disproportionate effort.

### 6. Data Portability

You have the right to receive personal data you provided to us *in a structured, commonly used and machine‑readable format* and to transmit it to another controller where processing is based on consent (Art. 6 (1) a GDPR / Art. 9 (2) a GDPR) or contract (Art. 6 (1) b GDPR) and carried out by automated means. Where technically feasible, you may request direct transmission.

### 7. Right to Objection

You may object **at any time**, on grounds relating to your particular situation, to processing based on Art. 6 (1) e or f GDPR (including profiling). We shall cease processing unless we demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds overriding your interests or for legal claims.

Where personal data is processed for **direct marketing**, you may object at any time, including to profiling related to such marketing; we will then no longer process data for that purpose.

### 8. Right to Withdraw Consent

You may withdraw your consent **at any time**. Withdrawal does not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before withdrawal.

### 9. Right of Appeal to a Supervisory Authority

Without prejudice to other remedies, you may lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority if you believe processing of your personal data contravenes applicable law.
